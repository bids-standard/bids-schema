# BIDS Extension Proposals (BEPs) Schemas

This directory contains automatically generated schemas for BIDS Extension Proposals.
Each BEP schema is linked to its corresponding Pull Request in the BIDS specification repository.

## Overview

This directory provides compiled schemas for BEPs that have associated Pull Requests with schema changes.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a BEP number and contains:
- `schema/` - The raw schema files from the associated PR
- `schema.json` - The compiled BIDS schema
- `BEP_METADATA` - Metadata about the BEP and its PR association
